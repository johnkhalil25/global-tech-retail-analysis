Data analysis project for Global Tech Retail using Power BI and DAX, focusing on sales performance, customer behavior, marketing impact, and product returnÿ≥

## Introduction
This project aims to study and analyze the performance of **Global Tech Retail** using data analysis tools and the **DAX** language.  
The project focuses on evaluating sales performance, analyzing marketing efficiency, studying customer behavior across different age groups, identifying best- and worst-selling products, and analyzing returns to determine their causes and propose effective solutions.

## Project Description
The project provides a comprehensive analysis including:  
- **Sales Performance**: Identifying top and low-performing products, revenue trends, and market variations.  
- **Customer Behavior**: Analyzing purchasing patterns across age groups, with a focus on teenagers and seniors who have lower purchasing power.  
- **Marketing and Advertising Impact**: Measuring the efficiency of advertising campaigns, evaluating cost versus profit, and identifying the most effective channels.  
- **Product Returns**: Investigating the main causes of high return rates, particularly in Germany and the UK, and suggesting practical solutions.

The dataset used in this project was obtained from **Kaggle**, a leading global platform providing high-quality datasets for analytics and machine learning.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:  
1. Increase offers and advertising campaigns targeting teenagers and seniors to stimulate their purchases.  
2. Focus marketing efforts on underperforming markets, such as Germany, to boost sales.  
3. Improve advertising efficiency to reduce costs and maximize return on investment.  
4. Utilize traditional media channels (radio and TV) for senior customers to enhance engagement.  
5. Provide special and exclusive offers to the top five most active customers.  
6. Boost sales for underperforming products, including the Sports category, through promotional campaigns and targeted offers.  
7. Review shipping partners to address issues causing high product returns, which have exceeded **$39 million**.

## Conclusion
The project successfully analyzed **Global Tech Retail**'s performance in terms of sales, advertising, customer behavior, products, and returns.  
The findings led to actionable recommendations that can enhance overall performance and support data-driven decision-making, providing a foundation for more efficient future strategies.
